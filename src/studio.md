Currently, we offer two main options for running your campaign:

* **Reach** This option will serve the ads to everyone
 > It's ideal for brand awareness campaigns, as it maximizes the reach of your ad to a wide audience. This approach is great for introducing new products or services and building a broad audience base.
* **Conversion**  uses our algorithm to target the most appropriate users, maximizing engagement and conversions.
 >  It aims to drive higher engagement and conversion rates. It is perfect for campaigns that have specific goals such as sales, sign-ups, or other user interactions, ensuring that your ad budget is spent more effectively.

Additionally, you can target viewers based on their net worth. For example, if you want your ad to be seen only by users with a wallet balance between $100 and $100,000, adjust the slider to reflect these values.

Lastly, you can select among different campaign tags to help filter users who are interested in these categories.
