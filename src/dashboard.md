- **Running** - For all currently live campaigns
- **Ended** - For all your past campaigns which have been executed
- **Stopped** - For all paused campaigns
- **PendingReview** When your campaign is created, but waits for an approval from us
- **PendingPayment** When the campaign is created, but the deposit hasn't arrived yet (it can take some time depending on the payment methond you selected)

2. Next to the status bar, you see the campaign name: **Example Campaign**
3. Below you will find information about your campaign.
