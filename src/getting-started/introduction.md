# Introduction
Welcome to GrowthMate Docs! 

Here, you will learn more about our product and how it can help you serve hyper-targeted ads.

## About
When we started GrowthMate, we discovered several exciting opportunities in the web3 space. Traditional web2 advertising methods often depend on collecting browsing history, cookies, and likes. In contrast, web3 allows us to utilize more robust data, such as transaction history, wallet balances, or even the time between transactions.

Leveraging this valuable data along with our expertise, we developed a machine learning algorithm that can analyze and predict future events related to users' wallets. For instance, our algorithm can predict the next possible action of a specific user with over 80% accuracy. This powerful insight can be used to make decisions based on wallet activity.

In the advertising sector, this advantage can significantly improve targeting, increase conversion rates, and achieve higher Return On Ad Spend (ROAS). This not only benefits advertisers but also helps publishers present higher-quality ads.

We believe that our model offers substantial benefits to the industry, and we are excited to have you here.
