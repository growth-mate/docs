# GrowthMate is versatile

At the core, GrowthMate is a general purpose ranking engine that is able to determine what content is most relevant / interesting to the user.
We use it to rank ad campaigns to power our ad network, and we use it to rank posts to enable our discovery feed, but if needed we can also rank any other arbitrary list of items based on the users interest.
