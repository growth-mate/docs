# General Purpose Ranking

At its core, GrowthMate is a versatile ranking model that sorts content by relevance based on a user's transaction history, reflecting their interests. We provide this powerful tool through a simple API that can process any number of items—represented as topics, similar to hashtags on platforms like Instagram or Twitter—and return an interest-aligned ranking. This makes it easy to sort a wide range of content. Common use cases include ranking suggested dApps, quests, and news for users to explore.
